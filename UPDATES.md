# Flash Merchant Signup Static Export Updates

This document summarizes the changes made to address the issues with the deprecated `next export` command and improve the static export process for the Flash Merchant Signup application.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Next.js Configuration**:

   - Modified `next.config.js` to use the new `output: 'export'` configuration instead of the deprecated `next export` command
   - Made the configuration conditional based on the `IS_BUILD_TIME` environment variable

2. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   - Removed the explicit `next export` command from the workflow
   - Added environment variable `IS_BUILD_TIME=true` to trigger the export configuration
   - Enhanced API fallback creation to ensure credentials are available in static builds
   - Improved verification steps to check for critical files
   - Added more robust error handling for file copying operations

3. **Package.json Scripts**:

   - Updated the build scripts to use the new approach
   - Added a test script to verify the static build locally
   - Deprecated the old build:static script that used next export

4. **Enhanced Environment Variable Handling**:

   - Added `env-config.js` to safely embed Supabase credentials in static builds
   - Added fallbacks in the useCredentials hook for static deployments
   - Created static JSON fallbacks for API routes

5. **Documentation and Debugging**:
   - Created STATIC_BUILD.md to document the static build process
   - Added CI environment debugging script for troubleshooting
   - Enhanced console logging for better visibility into the build process

## Testing

To test the new static export approach:

```bash
# Test locally with mock credentials
npm run build:static:test

# Start a local server to test the build
npx serve out
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to GitHub**: Push these changes to the repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Verify Deployment**: Check that the static site is correctly deployed to DigitalOcean
3. **Test Form Submission**: Verify that the form submission and file uploads work with the embedded Supabase credentials

## Troubleshooting

If there are any issues with the deployment:

1. Run `npm run env-debug` to check environment variable availability
2. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed build information
3. Verify that Supabase credentials are correctly embedded in the static build
4. Check that the React app UI is rendering correctly in the static deployment
