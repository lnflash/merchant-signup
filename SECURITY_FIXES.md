# Security Fixes

This document summarizes the security improvements implemented to address vulnerabilities identified in the security audit. We've implemented fixes for all critical vulnerabilities and many high-priority issues.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Insecure File Storage

- **Issue:** Public storage buckets exposed sensitive ID documents and business information
- **Fix:**
  - Changed all storage buckets to private by default
  - Updated RLS policies to enforce proper authorization
  - Implemented secure file naming using cryptographic methods
  - Added proper access control for file storage

### 2. Missing Authentication

- **Issue:** Form submissions lacked proper authentication, allowing anonymous submissions
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented authentication middleware for API routes
  - Created auth API endpoints for sign-in and sign-up
  - Added authentication flow to signup process
  - Updated database schema with user_id reference
  - Modified RLS policies to enforce ownership of records

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection

- **Issue:** No CSRF tokens implemented in form submission API
- **Fix:**
  - Added CSRF token generation and validation
  - Created CSRF middleware for API routes
  - Implemented double submit cookie pattern
  - Added CSRF token endpoint for client requests
  - Added client-side CSRF service for token management

## High-Priority Issues Fixed

### 1. Weak Input Validation

- **Issue:** Insufficient validation for phone numbers, missing maximum length constraints
- **Fix:**
  - Enhanced validation with stricter rules
  - Added server-side validation to complement client-side checks

### 2. File Upload Security

- **Issue:** Insecure file naming and insufficient content verification
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented cryptographically secure file naming
  - Added server-side content type verification
  - Prevented form submission with mock URLs in production

### 3. Error Disclosure

- **Issue:** API returning detailed error messages exposing internal structure
- **Fix:**
  - Sanitized error responses to avoid leaking internal details
  - Added proper error logging for debugging without exposing sensitive info
  - Implemented reference IDs for tracking issues without exposing details

### 4. Data Protection

- **Issue:** Sensitive information exposed in logs and responses
- **Fix:**
  - Properly redacted sensitive data in logs
  - Removed environment variable exposure in API responses
  - Sanitized debug information in production

## Outstanding Items

The following security improvements are still recommended:

1. Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
2. Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
3. Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
4. Add IP-based suspicious activity detection

## Testing

All security fixes have been tested and verified. These changes substantially improve the security posture of the application while maintaining full functionality.

## Documentation

The `SECURITY.md` file has been updated to document the security measures implemented in the application.
