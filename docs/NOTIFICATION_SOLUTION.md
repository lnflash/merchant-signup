# Email Notification Solution

## Problem Solved

We identified and fixed the main issue: your form submissions were failing because a database trigger was trying to use the HTTP extension to send email notifications directly from PostgreSQL.

The fix we implemented:

1. Modified the database trigger to avoid using HTTP
2. Added a notification tracking system via a `notification_sent` column
3. Created a logging system to keep track of events

## Next Step: Implementing the Notification System

Now that your form is correctly capturing all data including account type, business details, and terminal preferences, you need to implement a proper notification system.

## Edge Function for Checking Notifications

I've created a new Edge Function (`check_pending_notifications.ts`) that:

1. Queries the database for signups where `notification_sent = false`
2. Sends email notifications via Mailgun
3. Updates the `notification_sent` status when emails are sent
4. Logs notification activities

### How to Deploy

1. From your Supabase project's Functions section, create a new function:

   ```bash
   supabase functions new check-pending-notifications
   ```

2. Copy the content of `check_pending_notifications.ts` to the new function

3. Deploy the function:

   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy check-pending-notifications --no-verify-jwt
   ```

4. Set the required secrets:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-api-key
   supabase secrets set MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-mailgun-domain
   ```

### Setting Up Scheduled Execution

To regularly check for pending notifications, you can set up a scheduled GitHub Action:

1. Create a file at `.github/workflows/check-notifications.yml`:

```yaml
name: Check Pending Notifications

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *' # Run every 15 minutes
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering

jobs:
  check-notifications:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Invoke Check Notifications Function
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://uygbqnrqwjvzdfbqeipf.functions.supabase.co/check-pending-notifications" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

2. Add your Supabase anon key to GitHub repository secrets

## Testing

To test the system:

1. Submit a form with account_type = business or merchant
2. Verify the data is saved correctly in the `signups` table
3. Check that `notification_sent` is set to false
4. Manually invoke the `check-pending-notifications` function
5. Verify the notification is sent and `notification_sent` is updated to true

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Decoupled Architecture**: Database triggers don't directly send emails
2. **Reliable Notifications**: Even if notifications fail, form data is safely saved
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: All notification attempts are logged in the `signup_logs` table
4. **Scalable**: Can handle many signups without blocking form submissions

This solution maintains the notification capabilities while fixing the form submission issues.
