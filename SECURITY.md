## Security Measures

This application implements the following security measures:

### Storage Security

- All storage buckets for user uploads are private by default
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce proper access control
- Files are stored with cryptographically secure random names
- Storage access is restricted to authenticated users only

### API Security

- Error responses provide minimal information to clients (no leaking of internal details)
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Detailed error information is only logged server-side, not exposed to clients
- Reference IDs are generated for tracking issues without exposing sensitive data

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data is redacted in logs
- User credentials are never stored in client-side code
- Only necessary information is collected from users
- Form submissions validate data both client-side and server-side

### Authentication

- Supabase authentication is used to secure access to sensitive operations
- File uploads require valid authentication
- Row-level security policies enforce proper data access

## Future Security Enhancements

- Implement API rate limiting
- Add CSRF protection to all forms
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Conduct regular security audits
