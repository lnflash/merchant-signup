# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing security@example.com or by creating a confidential issue. We take all security reports seriously and will respond promptly.

## Security Measures

This application implements the following security measures:

### Storage Security

- All storage buckets for user uploads are private by default
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce proper access control
- Files are stored with cryptographically secure random names
- Storage access is restricted to authenticated users only
- File uploads use cryptographically secure naming patterns
- Storage buckets have restricted visibility settings

### API Security

- Error responses provide minimal information to clients (no leaking of internal details)
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Detailed error information is only logged server-side, not exposed to clients
- Reference IDs are generated for tracking issues without exposing sensitive data
- CSRF protection implemented for all form submissions
- Double submit cookie pattern to prevent CSRF attacks

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data is redacted in logs
- User credentials are never stored in client-side code
- Only necessary information is collected from users
- Form submissions validate data both client-side and server-side
- Database access restricted by Row Level Security policies
- Records linked to user accounts with proper ownership checks

### Authentication

- Supabase authentication is used to secure access to sensitive operations
- File uploads require valid authentication
- Row-level security policies enforce proper data access
- API endpoints require authentication
- User data is only accessible to the user who created it

### CSRF Protection

- All forms include CSRF tokens
- Form submissions require valid CSRF tokens
- CSRF tokens are linked to user sessions
- CSRF validation is implemented using the double submit cookie pattern
- CSRF tokens expire after a limited time

## Future Security Enhancements

- Implement API rate limiting
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Implement IP-based suspicious activity detection
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- Conduct regular security audits
